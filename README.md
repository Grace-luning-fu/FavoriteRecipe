This practice is about adding tables into and basic bootstrap styles(jumbotron and navbar) to HTML
note: 
1. Main controller has to be under the project prackage; 
2. if "nekohtml" is not inclued in the dependencies, all tags has to be closed to make it be able to run. 

		<dependency>
			<groupId>net.sourceforge.nekohtml</groupId>
			<artifactId>nekohtml</artifactId>
		</dependency>
